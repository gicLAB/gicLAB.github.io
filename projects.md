## Current Projects

* **[dAIEDGE (A network of excellence for distributed, trustworthy, efficient and scalable AI at the Edge)](https://daiedge.eu/), 09/2023 - 08/2026, funded by [Horizon Europe](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe_en)**
    
    The dAIEDGE project is ‘A network of excellence for distributed, trustworthy, efficient and scalable AI at the Edge’. The network has a project volume of €14.4 million, of which €10.7 million is funded by the European Union, across 36 partners. gicLAB is actively working on contributions related to software and hardware components of this project.

* **SECDA-DSE (Automated Design Space Exploration of FPGA-based Accelerators using LLMs), 08/2025 - 07/2026, funded by UKRI [APRIL AI Hub](https://april.ac.uk/)**

    The SECDA-DSE (Automated Design Space Exploration of FPGA-based Accelerators using LLMs) project is funded by the UKRI APRIL AI Hub and aims to provide a novel automated design space exploration (DSE) solution for designing FPGA-based accelerators utilising Large Language Models (LLMs) with iterative fine-tuning to adapt to the evaluated performance.

## Industry Collaboration
Our group collaborates with researchers from a variety of companies and agencies, including:
 - STMicroelectronics
 - AMD

If you're interested in collaborating on research there are opportunities for industrial PhDs, visiting researchers, and others.  Please [contact us](../contact) to discuss details.


## Past Projects

* **[MAISE (Multimodal AI-based Security at the Edge)](https://petras-iot.org/project/multimodal-ai-based-security-at-the-edge-maise/), 11/2021 - 08/2023, funded by [PETRAS](https://petras-iot.org/)**

    The MAISE project investigates the resilience of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) models on IoT-scale devices.

* **[AIMDDE (AI-based Manufacturing Defect Detection at the Edge)](../2022-01-25-aimdde_announce/), 02/2022 - 03/2022, funded by EU’s Horizon [BonsAPPs](https://bonsapps.eu/) AI Talents 1st Open Call**

    The Glasgow Intelligent Computing Lab (gicLAB) was awarded funding to undertaking the AIMDDE (AI-based Manufacturing Defect Detection at the Edge) research challenge, in response to the Open Call for AI Talents of the BonsAPPs Horizon 2020 project. We succesfully met all of the goals of the challenge, was were able to adapt the work into [a paper at AccML 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09359). Please [see our blogpost](../2022-01-25-aimdde_announce/), and <https://bonsapps.eu/> for details.
